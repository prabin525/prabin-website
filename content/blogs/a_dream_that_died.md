Nepal has done good keeping the scoreline nil-nil till the end of regular time against the mighty Brazil. Two penalty saves from the Nepali Goalkeeper captain Bhandari has been the highlight of the game so far._

OHH what's it happening, the Nepali goalkeeper Bhandari is joining the attack for the cornor. The corner kick is taken and Bhandari Scores with a beautiful header. Unbelievable !!!! Bhandari the goalkeeping sensation of Nepal has probably won the world cup for Nepal._

_The final whistle blows. And Nepal has done it, against all odds. A first timer in the world cup, Nepal has won it. There's tears everywhere. Nepal's Captain and their hero, their goalkeeping sensation is all in tears._


What you just read has been my dream ever since I saw The Titan Oliver Kahn, play for Germany in the 2002 world cup. I used to watch and play football before 2002 but the main reason that I am in love with this beautiful game is the 2002 world cup. The world cup that year took place in Korea japan and most of the matches were during our evening time and it was perfect for us to watch the beautiful game after returning from school. This particular world cup was able to ignite a serious interest for this game in a 6/7 year old me and ever since that moment there are very few things that I adore more than it. 

With every moment of passing of time, my love and my interest for this game grew even more strong. Almost about a year or two later after the 2002 world cup, I came to know about Real Madrid C.F. and from that moment I knew that my friendship with this club is everlasting. After four years from the 2002 world cup, the world cup was back again and this time the world cup was in Germany. By this time I was playing football regularly. We had a local kid club and we would play matches with other clubs during holidays and all other day before or after the school we all would train. Those were the best and golden days of my life. 2006 world cup was over, Germany finished 3rd. 

After 2006 , the dream that I had of winning world cup with Nepal was even more strong. People would praise me of my playing. We were a know club all around New Baneshwor Area, at least that was what I felt. I had played in Dashrath Rangashala already, the national stadium of Nepal. 

Around 2009/2010 something peculiar happened to me. It was not that my love for the beautiful game was any less but I was not in the field playing as much as I would have wanted to. Maybe the studies in the higher grade was more or maybe some people in the community who believed that football can't be a profession in our country had installed their thoughts into my mind. 

I used to play occasionally but I had started watching the game much more. I would be up all night to watch Real Madrid's games. In our school too during our classes, me and my friends would create formations and teams. We used to play FIFA game in computers too. Football still was a big part of my life but I was not playing it as much as I would have wanted to. 

Though my playing time was limited and I used to play much less, the dream that I had of representing Nepal in the world cup was intact with me. I would think about it all the time. I was waiting for a perfect miracle to happen to me. A miracle that would place me in the eyes of scouts of real Madrid and I would go on to play for Madrid and win the champions league there and then I would qualify Nepal for the world cup and win it too. This was impossible but nobody can stop me from dreaming. 

2014 world cup was here, By this time I was in my late teens and was already enrolled in Engineering Bachelor's Degree and was in my first year. Germany won the world cup. Though I was among the Motes in my class, the dream of representing my country in the world cup was as fresh as it was during the 2002 world cup when I was just a 6 year old kid. 

2014 to 2018 my playtime was much more limited, once a month maybe but the dream was alive. Now, the 2018 world cup is with us. 32 nations have qualified and are battling it out in Russia for the ultimate glory but there is no Nepal and I am just an spectator cheering for Germany to win the world cup. I have completed my bachelor's education.  I have job and it has been month's since I last touched the ball. My love for the game is same or even more then before. It is no less, I am still waiting for my miracle to happen. But let's be reasonable , it's never going to happen. As an engineer and as a grown up now, it's my duty to separate fantasy from reality and with that in mind and a heavy heart and some tears in my eyes I must realize today that the dream that I had ever since a kid of representing Nepal in the world cup and wining it is "A dream that Died".
