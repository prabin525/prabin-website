In this running world of technology, there is growing demand for the software systems to
recognize characters in computer system when information is scanned through images or paper documents so that the information can be stored in digitized manner in more compact form and can be retrieved quickly and efficiently. This project deals with the development of an application based on similar problem domain. Our project mainly focuses on identification of the vehicle number plate. Our current project work is based on the implementation of certain aspect of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Image Processing. Automatic License Plate Recognition has been a huge success around the globe but has yet not been implemented in Nepal. To overcome this problem this project depicts the way of recognizing the native Nepali characters from a vehicle number plate so that digitized character output can be obtained. To accomplish this project we have used the concept of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) through the knowledge of Artificial Neural Network where the image of Number plate is first processed to get in a desired format and is then fed as input to the network and then we get digital character as output.
